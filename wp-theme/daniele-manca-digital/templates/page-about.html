        I help business owners turn their websites into real business assets — not sources of confusion, stress, or quiet risk.

        <p>
          Specifically, I work with professional service firms and established e-commerce businesses who are tired of second-guessing digital decisions and want a website they can trust to support credibility, revenue, and long-term growth.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white font-medium border-l-2 border-white pl-4">
          Without hype. Without jargon. And without needing to micromanage every detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I didn't always see websites this way — and I understand why so many businesses feel stuck.

            I know how uncomfortable it is to rely on something you don't fully trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've seen what happens when a website looks fine on the surface, but underneath is unclear, over-complicated, or misaligned with the actual business. When decisions are made reactively. When vendors speak in abstractions. When responsibility is fragmented and no one is truly accountable.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the outside, everything can appear "done." But internally, there's hesitation.
          </p>
          <p>
             For service firms, that uncertainty shows up as inconsistent enquiries or weakened credibility. For e-commerce businesses, it shows up as conversion friction, fragile systems, or revenue that doesn't feel dependable.
